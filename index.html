        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Alfred, a curious and driven student who enjoys building things,
          breaking them, and learning from the process. I’m big on growth,
          hands-on learning, and not getting comfortable with being average. In
          my downtime, I enjoy watching movies, playing games, and exploring new
          technologies that spark my curiosity.

          <h2>My Goals</h2>
          <p>
            I have a lot honestly, but if I was to narrow it down i'd say my
            goal is to grow into a highly skilled tech
            professional, create impactful solutions, and continuously challenge
            myself to be better than I was yesterday even if that means having a
            very messed up sleep schedule (I'm working on it).
